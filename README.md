[h2]"Why don’t Industrial & Electronics Technologies all go until 1945?"[/h2]
[i]I’m not sure, but [b]now they do![/b] This mod adds a continuation to the industry and electronics technology trees bringing them up to 1945. All these technologies have a longer time to research and/or slightly reduced buffs when compared to their previous iterations to not destroy the balance of late-game scenarios.[/i]

[list]
[*] Continuation For All Industry & Electronics Technologies Through 1945
