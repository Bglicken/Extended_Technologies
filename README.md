****Extended Technologies****

**Current Mod Version:** 1.0.0, release Early-Mid 2024 
**Current HOI4 Version Supported:** 1.13.6

"Why don’t all technology trees go until 1945?" I’m not sure, but now they do! This mod adds a continuation to all technology trees bringing them up to 1945. All these technologies have been modified when compared to their previous iterations to not destroy the balance of late-game scenarios. This mod intends to hold onto the feel of vanilla Hearts of Iron IV and acts as more of an enhancement rather than an overhaul.

**Features** 

-Continuation For All Technology Trees Through 1945 

-Unique Icons and Lore For Each New Technology 

-No DLC Required [] Compatible With Any Mod That Does Not Modify Technologies

**State Of The Mod** 
This mod is currently in early development and will integrate the three following mods, which will no longer be updated after their integration into this mod. All new features to any technology trees will now be found here. Following the mod integrations and the addition of the artillery and armor trees, other than bugfix updates, content updates will only follow the release of DLC's.
